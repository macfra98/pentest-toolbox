```
filemagic -e png -b php
... generates a png file with a backdoor ...

filemagic -e gif -c "<some code here>"
... tries its best to predict the filetype to imbedd the "code" into ...

```

## vulscanner ##
using nmap, vulnscanner simply scans an IP and its "open" ports and outputs the scanresult to a docxfile.
```
vulnscanner -i 127.0.0.1 -p 1234,555,12
