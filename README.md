```

### 3. Setup ###
Setup environment 
```
$ sh install.sh

## binsploit ##
binsploit is a simple tool that fetches specific binary exploits from a local database based on

## repgen (WIP)##
[!OBS] repgen is currently only supports OpenAI for report automation, however automating notetaking isn't using any LLM. 
repgen is a tool which is used for automating a report. It can also be used for automating notetaking (not yet) during the early stages of a pentest.

```
repgen
[0] generate notes
[1] generate report
[->] <?>
```
## autopfuscate (WIP) ##
autopfuscate is a tool that opfuscates (encodes) pieces of code such as reverse shells. The purpose is to automate the process of opfscating code to evade AMSI (Anti Malware Scan Interface) in a OS such as Windows, 
but also other systems such as *unix based ones.

```
autopfuscate -t base64 -s rev -i 127.0.0.1 -p 1337 -e ps1 -o windows

> ... output ... (also generates a .ps1 file with the opfuscated code)
```

## passcrack ##
passcrack is a password cracker that contains two different scripts, one that utilizes multiprocessing and one that tries to mix multithreading with multiprocessing to split the task of reading the given wordlist

```
passcrack -w <wordlist> -f <hashfile>
... cracking ...

```

## filemagic ##
filemagic is a file manipulation tool that can generate specific filetypes and imbedd backdoors. Files such as png,gif,jpeg,xlsx,pdf,etc...

```
filemagic -e png -b php
... generates a png file with a backdoor ...

filemagic -e gif -c "<some code here>"
... tries its best to predict the filetype to imbedd the "code" into ...

```
